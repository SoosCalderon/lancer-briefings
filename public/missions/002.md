# Mission // #002
## First Impressions

You've arrived to Deani, a jungle planet in the OR-XY736 System (*Local Designation: Boudica*). The ship touches down deep within a jungle. Upon disembarking the MSMC Affadavit, you are greeted by the sight of a administration building and an armed escort. 

Inside you find Brickev Tinand, your point of contact for this contract between you and the Union Administrative Department. While discussing the terms and end goal of your employment, you hear faint explosions in the distance. Alarms begin to ring across the facility.

# Goals
- Defend the critical infrastructure surrounding the facility.
- Identify the assailaints.

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, power and communications will be lost to the facility, forcing the Union deployment to retreat to a secondary facility equipped with less resources.

# Reserves
- 3x Additional Repairs.
